Lego Carcassonne
================

These are the source files for my Lego Carcassonne models. You'll need <a href="http://staff.polito.it/sergio.reano/">SR 3D Builder</a> to edit them and <a href="http://www.povray.org">POV-Ray</a> (with some addons) to render them.

You can find a lot more details, including sample renders, in <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/lego-carcassonne/">this article</a>.

The <code>.l3b</code> and <code>.ldr</code> files are the same format and contain the model designs. The <code>.pov</code> files are rendering instrcutions. All of the files are hand-editable.
